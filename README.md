# Zoom Paid User Performance Analysis - COVID Impact Assessment

## Business Context
In this portfolio analysis, I examined Zoom's subscription performance during the critical 2020-2021 period from the perspective of a Business Analyst supporting the Sales and Marketing teams' strategic planning and revenue recovery initiatives following the unprecedented pandemic-driven growth and subsequent market stabilization.

## Business Question

Primary Question: 
- How did the pandemic impact our subscription revenue trends across different customer segments, and where should we focus our efforts to maintain growth momentum?

Supporting Questions:
- Which plan types and regions drove our pandemic growth, and how sustainable are these trends?
- What seasonal patterns emerged that we should account for in our sales forecasting?
- Where are we seeing concerning revenue drops that require immediate attention?

## Key Business Metrics Analyzed

- Subscription Revenue: Weekly bookings performance across all plan tiers ($2.1M+ analyzed)
- Customer Segmentation: Enterprise vs. Business vs. Pro plan performance and trends
- Geographic Performance: Regional revenue distribution and volatility patterns
- Contract Value: Annual vs. monthly subscription preference and revenue impact

## Executive Summary
Enterprise segment drove pandemic growth with $226K weekly peak but shows concerning seasonal vulnerability. Business plan revenue has completely disappeared by end of 2021, indicating competitive threat or product issue. Annual contracts represent 90%+ of revenue but declining, risking our most valuable customer base.

## Key Business Insights
1. Enterprise Segment Shows High Growth Potential but Seasonal Risk
- Finding: Enterprise plans spiked to record $226K weekly bookings during early pandemic but consistently drop 40-50% during summer months
- Business Impact: This seasonal pattern puts $1.8M+ in quarterly revenue at risk during summer periods
- Recommendation: Partner with Product team to develop enterprise-specific features or summer campaign strategies to maintain engagement during traditional low-demand periods

2. Business Plan Segment Facing Critical Revenue Threat
- Finding: Business plan bookings completely disappeared by end of 2021 after steady decline throughout the year
- Business Impact: Loss of mid-market segment could indicate competitive displacement, potentially worth $500K+ in annual recurring revenue
- Recommendation: Conduct immediate competitive analysis and customer exit interviews to understand if this is a pricing, feature, or market positioning issue requiring urgent product/marketing intervention

3. Annual Contract Strategy Under Pressure Despite High Value
- Finding: Annual subscriptions generate 90%+ of total bookings but showed sharp decline in late 2021 while monthly remained stable
- Business Impact: Annual contracts are our highest-value, lowest-churn customers - any decline directly impacts predictable revenue and customer lifetime value
- Recommendation: Work with Sales team to implement annual contract incentives, trials, or promotional offers to reverse this trend before it significantly impacts 2022 ARR targets

4. North America Over-Concentration Creates Geographic Risk
- Finding: North America generated nearly 67% of pandemic peak revenue, with EMEA showing highest volatility across regions
- Business Impact: Heavy reliance on single region creates revenue vulnerability to North American market changes
- Recommendation: Develop region-specific growth strategies for EMEA market stabilization and expand marketing efforts in APAC and LATAM to diversify revenue base

## Methodology
